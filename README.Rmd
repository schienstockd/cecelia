The goal of `cecelia` is to simplify image analysis for immunologists and integrate
static and live cell imaging with flow cytometry data. The package primarily builds upon
[`napari`](https://napari.org) and [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Our aim was 
to combine shiny's graph plotting engine with napari's image display.

__This package is pre-alpha__

## Documentation
