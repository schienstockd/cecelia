The goal of `cecelia` is to simplify image analysis for immunologists and integrate
static and live cell imaging with flow cytometry data. The package primarily builds upon
[`napari`](https://napari.org) and [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Our aim was 
to combine shiny's graph plotting engine with napari's image display.

__This package is pre-alpha__

## Installation

__This package currently only works on Unix systems.__ We have a Docker version to support other
systems if necessary, so do open an `issue` if that is needed and we will help you setting it up.

We designed `cecelia` to also process jobs on the `HPC` (High Performance Computing) system.
We currently only support `Slurm` as a scheduler. If you want to set this up on 
your system - please open an `issue` and we will get you started.

All components can be packaged within a `conda` environment.
We recommend to install [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you want
to keep a separate environment. If you opt for this, then you should also install
`RStudio` within that conda environment.

```bash
conda create -y -n r-cecelia-env -c conda-forge python=3.9
conda activate r-cecelia-env
conda install -c conda-forge r-base=4.1.2 rstudio
```

You can install the development version of `cecelia` like so:
```r
if (!require("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("schienstockd/cecelia")
```

For first time users, you will need to define base directory where
configuration files, models and the shiny app will be stored. `cecelia` depends
on a python environment which needs to be created. There are multiple options available
depending on how you would like to use the app:

- `image` For image analysis on Desktop

- `image-nogui` For image processing without GUI

- `flow` For flow cytometry analysis

```r
library(cecelia)

# install App requirements
# (i) they are not needed when using only markdown files or on HPC
cciaAppRequirements()

# install Bioconductor requirements
cciaBiocRequirements()

# setup cecelia directory
cciaSetup("~/path/to/cecelia")

# create conda environment
cciaCondaCreate()
# cciaCondaCreate(envType = "image-nogui") # to use without gui
# cciaCondaCreate(envType = "flow") # for flow based only

# download models for deep-learning segmentation
cciaModels()

# create app
cciaCreateApp()
```

You have to adjust the parameters in `~/path/to/cecelia/custom.yml` to your system.
You need download/install:

- [`bftools`](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.7.0/artifacts/bftools.zip)

- [`bioformats2raw`](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/releases/download/v0.4.0/bioformats2raw-0.4.0.zip)

- [`ImageJ`](https://imagej.net/imagej-wiki-static/Fiji/Downloads) if using Spot segmentation

For `ImageJ`, activate the following update sites:

- IJPB-plugins

- 3D-ImageJ-Suite

- Bio-Formats

```yml
default:
  dirs:
    bftools: "/Applications/BFTools"
    bioformats2raw: "/Applications/glencoe/bioformats2raw-0.3.0"
    projects: "/your/project/directory/"
  volumes:
    SSD: "/your/ssd/directory/"
    home: "~/"
    computer: "/"
  python:
    conda:
      env: "r-cecelia-env"
      source:
        env: "r-cecelia-env"
  imagej:
    path: "/Applications/Fiji.app/Contents/MacOS/ImageJ-macosx"
```

## Image analysis general workflow

```r
library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia", initJupyter = TRUE)
cciaRunApp(port = 6860)
```

1. Create a Project for `static` or `live`analysis.

2. Images have to be imported as `OME-ZARR`. Choose `Import Images` and create an `Experimental Set`.
It is helpful if all images within this set have the same colour combinations.
Add Images. Select all images you want to import and choose `OME-ZARR`.
Select the required `pyramid scales` and `run` the task.

3. Select `Image Metadata` and click `Load Metadata` to load the channel information.
You can assign channels either one by one by selecting a channel and `Specify Value` > `Assign Value`.
Alternatively, you can give a list of channels in the box and click `Assing channels`.
You can add further experimental attributes by `Create Attribute` and adding
respecive values for the individual images.

4. Select `Cell Segmentation` to segment your images.

5. Select `Population Gating` to use flow cytometry like gating to define populations.
Select `Populations Clustering` to use cluster algorithms to define populations.

6. Select `Spatial Analysis` to define spatial neighbourhoods, detect clustering cells or
detect contact between cells.

## Flow Cytometry general workflow

```r
library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia", initJupyter = FALSE)
cciaRunApp(port = 6860)
```

1. Create a Project for `flow`analysis.

2. `FCS` files can be imported either from raw or other sources such as `FlowJo`.
They will converted into an [`Anndata`](https://anndata.readthedocs.io) to perform clustering and
a [`GatingSet`](https://github.com/RGLab/flowWorkspace) to perform manual gating.

Compensation controls can be added into one `experimental set` which
can be used by `autospill` to calculate a `compensation matrix`. This matrix
can then be applied to the other samples.

3. The rest of the pipeline for `gating` and `plotting` is the same as for image analysis.

## Running workflows from `RMarkdown`

All Processing available in the app can be done from `RMarkdown`  as well.
Every image is `ReactivePersistentObject` whose state is saved in an `RDS` file
and is `reactive` in a `shiny` app context. These objects can be loaded and manipulated
as such:

```r
library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia")

# set test variables
pID <- "pEdOoZ"   # project ID
versionID <- 2    # version ID
uID <- "tPl6da"   # image ID

# init ccia object
cciaObj <- initCciaObject(
  pID = pID, uID = uID, versionID = versionID, initReactivity = FALSE
)

funParams <- list(
  pyramidScale = 4,
  dimOrder = "",
  createMIP = FALSE,
  rescaleImage = FALSE
)

cciaObj$runTask(
  funName = "importImages.omezarr",
  funParams = funParams,
  runInplace = TRUE
)
```

## 2D static image analysis - Spleen example

1. Create project

</p>

4. Segment cells

With conventional confocal microscopy it is not always possible to include a nuclear
stain for cell segmentation. In this case, we can check whether `cellpose` or 
a sequence of morphological filters which segments donut- and blob-like objects (`donblo`)
works for a partiular image.

- `cellpose` is a good choice for most cases. We use `cellpose` to segment a single
merged image. We can create a sequence of merged images to create individual segmentations
if necessary.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/2D_spleen/4_seg_cellpose_params.png" height="300"/>
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/2D_spleen/4_seg_cellpose.png" height="300"/>
</p>

- In this case, `cellpose` did not capture some of the more dense and noisy cells.
We have implemented a simple sequence of morphological filters with subsequent
spot detection and segmentation in `ImageJ` using `TrackMate` and the `3D Image Suite`.
The quality of the segmentation is lower than `cellpose` but it will capture
more cells, such as the `yellow XCR1+ DCs` within the `T cell zone`.

<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/2D_spleen/4_seg_donblo.png" height="300"/>
</p>

5. Gate cells

Cell populations can be created using `clustering` or `gating`. `Gating` cell populations 
will give you more control when using fewer markers. `Clustering` will be more beneficial 
when using `multiplex` images to identify multiparameter cell populations. In this case,
we will utilise `gating`. We have to create a `GatingSet` from the `label properties`.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/2D_spleen/5_create_gatingset.png" height="300"/>
</p>


After this we can open the image and do sequential gating for `T cells`, `Macrophages`,
`cDC1` and `cDC2`.

</p>

6. Create spatial neighbours

We can use these populations to create `spatial neighbours`.

</p>

7. Custom plotting of interactions

Our aim is to provide custom plots within `cecelia` but this is still in development. The following 
is illustrating how to use the generated populations for customised plotting within 
`RMarkdown`. This simple example shows the interactions between `T cells` and
`cDC1` in the `T cell zone`.

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

library(cecelia)
cciaUse("~/path/to/cecelia")

# set test variables
pID <- "s3n6dR"   # project ID
versionID <- 1    # version ID
uID <- "LvfcHB"   # image ID

# init ccia object
cciaObj <- initCciaObject(
  pID = pID, uID = uID, versionID = versionID, initReactivity = FALSE
)

# get populations
popDT <- cciaObj$popDT("flow", pops = cciaObj$popPaths("flow"))

# get spatial information
spatialDT <- cciaObj$spatialDT()

# join pops
spatialDT[popDT[, c("label", "pop")],
          on = c("to" = "label"),
          pop.to := pop]
spatialDT[popDT[, c("label", "pop")],
          on = c("from" = "label"),
          pop.from := pop]

# filter same type associations
spatialDT <- spatialDT[pop.to != pop.from]

# get interaction frequencies
freqRegions <- spatialDT %>%
  group_by(pop.from, pop.to) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = n/sum(n)) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  complete(pop.from, pop.to, fill = list(freq = 0))

ggplot(freqRegions,
       aes(pop.from, pop.to)) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = freq), colour = "white", size = 0.5) +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(
    breaks = c(0, 0.5),
    labels = c(0, 0.5)
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.key.size = unit(3, "mm"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1)
  ) + xlab("") + ylab("")
```

</p>

8. Population detection by clustering

We have incorporated `UMAP` and `Leiden` to detect populations by clustering. 
Clustering can be done on `individual` images or combined on `multiple` images from 
the same set. If `multiple` images are used, the clustering results will be 
written back to the original `individual` images and subsequent analysis 
such as `neighbour detection` can be done on the `individual` images again. 
This is useful when processing a `batch` of images that have the same staining.

It is also possible to do `sequential clustering`, as a kind of multidimensional 
gate, by selecting `Root populations` from which to calculate clusters. 
__When you do not tick `Keep other populations` the other populations will 
be removed during clustering. So if you want to sequential clusters, please 
tick that box.__

<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/3_assign_channels.png" height="300"/>
</p>

4. Segment cells

We commonly use fluorescently stained cells for `two-photon` and `histology` imaging. 
We trained a `cellpose` model, called `ccia Fluorescent`, to detect these fluorescent cells as the pre-trained
models could not segment them. We can use this model to sequentially segment
`dendritic cells` (stained with `TRITC`) and `T cells`.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/4_seg_cellpose_DC.png" height="200"/>
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/4_seg_cellpose_T.png" height="200"/>
</p>

Sometimes the segmentation can benefit from a small morphological filter. In this
case we can use a `Gaussian` filter of `1` to improve segmentation results.

5. Gate cells

During imaging of thick tissue slices that were stained with antibodies it can happen
that staining intensity varies across the `depth` of the tissue due to antibody
penetration or differences in light properties and scattering within the tissue or
increase of laser power or gain due to reduction of signal with increasing depth.
For this reason, we incorporated `depth correction` by fitting `polynomial` function
to the signal across `depth`.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/depth_correction/TRITC_original.png" height="250"/>
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/depth_correction/TRITC_corrected.png" height="250"/>
</p>

We can use `gating` to identify `TRITC+ dendritic cells` and `T cells`.
In this image, we can also gate on `CD68+ T cells`.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_LN/5_gating.png" height="300"/>
</p>

6. Detect spatial interactions

For 3D objects it is helpful to generate `3D meshes` during segmentation.
These `meshes` can then be utilised to detect clusters of cells and interactions between cells.
Then we can check whether `CD69+ T cells` are in contact with `migrating TRITC+ cells` and
visualise these in `napari`.

</p>

4. Autofluorescence and drift correction

We correct autofluorescence by dividing channels from each other. In this example
there are only two which we can use for channel correction. The same module
function will also do drift correction based on [`phase cross correlation`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.registration.html#skimage.registration.phase_cross_correlation). We will use the `AF generated` channel that is generated
during autofluorescence correction.

6. Track cells

We incorporated [`btrack`](https://github.com/quantumjot/BayesianTracker/tree/38b144c09f384cb30c2fd9572f19f8dfb3007fca) to track segmented cells. `Filters` can be used to filter based on object measurements.

</p>

7. Extract cell behaviour

We utilised `HMM` (Hidden markov model) to extract behaviour from the generated tracks.
This analysis extracts a defined number of cellular behaviours based on `shape` and
`movement` parameters. For this method, we combine tracking data from multiple
images - therefore, we need to tick the box to `Combine images` when running the task.
This will run the task with the selected images from the `set`.

<p float="left">
<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_2P/7_HMM_task.png" height="220"/>

<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_2P/7_HMM_result.png" height="220"/>
</p>

We can visualise these behaviours on the image by creating a `filtered population`.

<img src="https://github.com/schienstockd/cecelia/raw/master/im/examples/3D_2P/7_HMM_pop_image.png" height="250"/>
</p>

Then we can map these behaviours in `time` and `space`.
