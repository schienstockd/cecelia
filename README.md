The goal of `cecelia` is to simplify image analysis for immunologists
and integrate static and live cell imaging with flow cytometry data. The
package primarily builds upon [`napari`](https://napari.org) and
[`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Our aim was to combine shiny’s
graph plotting engine with napari’s image display.

**This package is pre-alpha**
