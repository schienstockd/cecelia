Description: It aims to easily and rapidly generate raster data in R, even for very large datasets, with an aesthetics-based mapping syntax that should be familiar to users of the \code{ggplot2} package. While \code{rasterly} does not attempt to reproduce the full functionality of the \code{Datashader} graphics pipeline system for Python, the \code{rasterly} API has several core elements in common with that software package.
